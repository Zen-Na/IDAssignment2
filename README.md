# PokeDex
A PokeDex contains information and data of every single pokemon! Using PokeAPI, I have recreated the PokeDex normally seen in Pokemon shows and such. It has the function of searching up
desired pokemon to show its images, description and more!
## Design Process
This website is created so that there is an easy and convenient (nice looking too!) place to search up your favourite pokemon! Using an actual PokeDex image, I have incorporated
html, css and js within the image to mimic a functioning PokeDex. The target of this website will be those who are interested in finding out how the pokemons look like as a
sprite image as well as know information about the pokemon.
